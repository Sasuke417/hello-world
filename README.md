# hello-world

Hey world, look at me
Just wanna tell my story
They were born with destiny
And I'm not gonna be a Nobody
And everybody's gonna know my name
Everybody's gonna know my
Woooaaaaaah! Woooaaah!
Sitting at the bottom of a well in hell
I don't know how to climb up to the surface
I'm so nervous, thinking:
How can I, what can I, will I ever do? (Nobody)
Who am I, what will I, will I ever do?
I don't know!
Hey world, look at me
Just wanna tell my story
They were born with destiny
And I'm not gonna be a Nobody
And everybody's gonna know my name
Everybody's gonna know my name! (Woooaaaaaah!)
You're gonna know my name! (Woooaaah!)
You're gonna know my name! (Woooaaah!)
You're gonna know my name! (Woooaaah!)
Waiting for the opportunity to knock me awake
I need a shock, I need a shot, I need a slap in my face (Aaah!)
How can I, what can I, will I ever do? (Nobody)
Who am I, what will I, will I ever do?
Time to go!
Hey world, look at me
Just wanna tell my story
They were born with destiny
And I'm not gonna be a Nobody
And everybody's gonna know my name
Everybody's gonna know my name! (Woooaaaaaah!)
You're gonna know my name! (Woooaaah!)
You're gonna know my name! (Woooaaah!)
You're gonna know my name! (Woooaaah!)
I am not afraid to try (You're gonna know my name, my story!)
Live this life before I die (Not gonna stop 'til I see glory, see glory, see glory!)
You're gonna know my name!
[Speaking: Hey world, look at me - I just wanna tell my story
I was born with destiny, and I'm not gonna be a Nobody.]
Hey world, look at me
Just wanna tell my story
I was born with destiny
And I just wanna be Somebody
Not gonna stop 'til everybody knows!
(You're gonna know my name! (Woooaaah!))
Not gonna stop 'til everybody knows!

And everybody's gonna know my name!
Everybody's gonna know my name! (Woooaaah!)
Everybody's gonna know my name! (Woooaaah!)
Everybody's gonna know my name! (Woooaaah!)
You're gonna know my name! (Woooaaah!)
